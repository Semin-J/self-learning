jQuery
- JS library
- A large single .js file that has many pre-built methods and objects that simplify your workflow
- Specifically interacting with the DOM and making HTTP requests(AJAX)
- When jQuery was created, the more robust and convenient methods such as .querySelector() didn't exit
- jQuery was created as a way to help simplofy interactions with the DOM
- One of its main features is the use of '$'

** How to Use? **
1. Link a CDN hosted file (using <script>)
or
2. Download the js.file from jQuery's official website

** Difference between Vanilla JS and jQuery **
// jQuery
var divs = $('div');
$(el).css('border-width', '20px');

// Vanilla
var divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');
el.style.borderWidth = '20px';

//jQuery
$(document).ready(function(){ //code });

// Vanilla
function ready(fn) {
  if (document.readyState != 'loading') {
    fn();
  }
  else {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn);
  }
}
